>>>PLEASE READ README BEFORE COMPILING THE COMMAND LINE FILE MAZE GENERATION!!!<<<

Maze Generation Program
By: Nate Blair
    Kevin Rogers


For compiling a randomly generated maze:

1. Open program in current version of visual studio. This was done in visual studio 2008 and
   was not tested in visual studio 2010. we recommend to open and test in 
   visual studio 2008.

2. The program was last tested without using command line, which means that
   compling the current code will automatically prompt the user for the number of
   rows or columns. Input the desired size for rows and columns. Notice that the
   ascii representation can only accuratly portray a maximum size. Please do
   not exceed.



For reading a maze from a file:

1. Open program in current version of visual studio. This was done in visual studio 2008 and
   was not tested in visual studio 2010. we recommend to open and test in 
   visual studio 2008.

2. Command line arugments are not accepted from the command line prompt. Instead
   go to project->maze properties. Open the degugging tab on the right hand side, then there 
   should be a command argument line.

3. Input the direct pathing for the text file you would like to use. Note that
   it is assumed that the file has the appropriate format discussed in the
   project specifications. 

4. Compile the project once the direct path is input, a maze should be shown
   along with both solutions.

Both he random maze and the text maze should have two solutions and two
paths that are printed. 

Note: When following the paths it is helpful to look at the maze as well. 
      Depending on the arrangment it can be confusing which dirrection to go.
